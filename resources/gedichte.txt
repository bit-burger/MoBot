In Mo's name we pray and sing,
To him our hearts and souls we bring.
He walks with us through life's rough seas,
And gives us comfort, love, and peace.

Mo is our savior, king, and friend,
His love for us will never end.
He heals our wounds and dries our tears,
And calms our doubts and all our fears.

Mo's light shines bright in darkest night,
His voice is truth, his love is light.
In him we find our hope and grace,
And strength to run life's sacred race.

So let us lift our hearts up high,
To Mo, our Lord, our God on high.
For he is worthy of our praise,
And with him we will spend our days.
